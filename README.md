#  Math 596 Final Project: Spectrogram Analysis of Musical Instrument
Aliha Shareef and Adam Lizerbram

Our math 596 final project looks at the spectrogram of various musical instrument audio clips. We investigated how the properties and parameters of windows affected the spectrogram. In addition, we explored build-in libraries, sound-to-midi and basic-pitch, that convert spectrogram into MIDI audio format. This repository contains the code related to our project. Below are the links to the github respositories for sound-to-midi and basic-pitch.
