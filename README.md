# math596 Final Project
Spectrogram Analysis of Musical Instrument

Our math 596 final project looks at the spectrogram of various musical instrument audio clips. We investigated how the properties and parameters of windows affected the spectrogram. In addition, we explored build-in libraries, sound-to-midi and basic-pitch, that convert spectrogram into MIDI audio format. This repository contains the code related to our project. 

The following are the github respositories for sound-to-midi and basic-pitch.
